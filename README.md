# Project Title
CarDealership2

## Description of the Project

This project is updating the dealersip management system by including the sales and lease. Sales personnel will  be able to document sales or lease by updating the contract date, customer details and the VIN. 
There will be a way to calculate the pricing depending on what the customer chooses. For the sales contracts, you will be able to see the sales tax, recording fee, recording fee, and financing option which will be used to determine the monthly payment.
For lease contracts, it will make sure that the cars under the leasing agreement are no more than three years old. All of the contracts will be saved to a contracts file using a Contractfilemanager.
